# CODSOFT Internship

### About the Internship
This repository contains the projects I have completed as part of the CodSoft Internship Program. The internship focuses on hands-on experience in Machine Learning.

### Projects
#### 1. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description:** This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (stop using a service) based on various factors. The model helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

- **Dataset:** The dataset contains customer details from a banking institution. Below are the key features:  

| Column Name          | Description |

| **RowNumber**        | Unique index for each record |
| **CustomerId**       | Unique ID assigned to each customer |
| **Surname**          | Last name of the customer |
| **CreditScore**      | Customer’s credit score |
| **Geography**        | Country where the customer resides (e.g., France, Germany, Spain) |
| **Gender**           | Male or Female |
| **Age**              | Customer’s age |
| **Tenure**           | Number of years the customer has been with the bank |
| **Balance**          | Account balance of the customer |
| **NumOfProducts**    | Number of bank products used by the customer |
| **HasCrCard**        | Whether the customer owns a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **IsActiveMember**   | Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **EstimatedSalary**  | Estimated annual salary of the customer |
| **Churn** (Target)   | Whether the customer churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GdBoost

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
